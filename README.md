This is a video compression coding project which focus on implementing multiview video coding technology. I completed it with another 3 students in a course. We used source code provided by Jie Liang Ph.D, SFU and reference code of HEVC coding and multiview coding. Our main contribution are inside vidcodeclib decoder and vidcodeclib encoder.
